# Particle Theory Syllabus (Khan Academy Edition)

**Goal:** From Rusty Algebra to Python-Powered Orbital Mechanics
**Alignment:** Optimized for the 12-Unit Algebra 2 Course on Khan Academy.

### 🛑 Strategic Note

We are **not** doing all 12 units with equal intensity.

  * **Deep Dive:** Units 1, 5, 7, 8, and 11 (These are the "Physics Engines").
  * **Skim:** Units 2 and 9 (Good to know, but not critical for orbits).

-----

## PHASE 1: Kinematics & Curves (The Basics)

*Goal: Understanding how things move through space.*

| Week | Khan Academy Unit | Physics Application & Python Lab |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Unit 1: Polynomial Arithmetic**<br>*(Current)* | **Kinematics:** Position, Velocity, and Acceleration are just polynomial layers.<br>• *Lab:* Average Rate of Change (Secant Lines). |
| **2** | **Unit 5: Polynomial Graphs**<br>*(Skim Units 3 & 4)* | **Potential Energy Wells:** The "End Behavior" of a graph determines if a particle is trapped in orbit or escapes to infinity.<br>• *Lab:* Plotting Stability Curves (Parabola vs Cubic). |
| **3** | **Unit 10: Equations** | **Solving for Impact:** Finding the "Zeros" (roots) of a function tells you exactly when a rocket hits the ground.<br>• *Lab:* The Quadratic Formula Solver. |

-----

## PHASE 2: Rocketry & Propulsion (The Fuel)

*Goal: The math of changing mass and gravity.*

| Week | Khan Academy Unit | Physics Application & Python Lab |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **4** | **Unit 6: Rational Exponents** | **Kepler's Third Law:** Planetary orbital periods are related to distance by a $3/2$ power (Square root of cube).<br>• *Lab:* Calculating Orbital Periods of the Solar System. |
| **5** | **Unit 7 & 8: Exp Models & Logs** | **The Rocket Equation:** Tsiolkovsky's equation uses Natural Log ($\ln$). It is the only way to calculate fuel requirements.<br>• *Lab:* Coding a Multi-Stage Rocket Calculator. |

-----

## PHASE 3: The Orbit Engine (The Geometry)

*Goal: Simulating circular and elliptical motion.*

| Week | Khan Academy Unit | Physics Application & Python Lab |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **6** | **Unit 11: Trigonometry** | **Vectors & Orbits:** Breaking motion into X and Y components. Using Sin/Cos to simulate circular orbits.<br>• *Lab:* The Unit Circle vs. The Orbit. |
| **7** | **Unit 12: Modeling** | **System Simulation:** Putting it all together to simulate a simple solar system.<br>• *Lab:* Final Project - Earth/Moon Sim. |

-----

### 📚 Textbook Integration (Landau & Lifshitz)

*Keep your "Mechanics" book on the shelf until **Phase 3**.*

  * **Phase 1 & 2** build the toolbelt (Calculus & Algebra).
  * **Phase 3** provides the geometry.
  * **Post-Syllabus:** You will be ready to open **Landau Chapter 1** (Principle of Least Action) and actually derive these orbits from scratch.
