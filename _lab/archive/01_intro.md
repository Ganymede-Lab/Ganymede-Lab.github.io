In physics, the "Principle of Least Action" is one of the most elegant concepts in the universe. It states that nature is lazy. Light doesn't check every possible path before traveling; it simply takes the path that minimizes "action." It is efficient. It is optimized.

My path to understanding physics has been anything but.

### The "Garage Scientist" Approach
I am not a PhD candidate. I am not currently enrolled in a university. I am a self-taught tinkerer with a background in sales and automation, a basement full of electronics, and a dangerous amount of curiosity.

This blog, *The Least Action Principle*, is my digital lab notebook. It is an attempt to optimize a very chaotic journey: taking a brain that hasn't done serious math in 12 years and training it to understand the fundamental laws of the universe.

### The Trajectory
The goal is simple, even if the execution is not: **To derive the motion of the universe from scratch.**

We are starting at **Level 0**:
* **Math:** Rusty High School Algebra.
* **Physics:** Basic Newtonian concepts (F=ma).
* **Tools:** Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and a PixelBook.

We are aiming for **Level 100**:
* **The Text:** Landau & Lifshitz, *Course of Theoretical Physics, Vol 1: Mechanics*. (Known as the "Dark Souls" of physics textbooks).
* **The Math:** Calculus of Variations, Lagrangian Mechanics, and Differential Equations.
* **The Application:** Building high-fidelity computer simulations of orbital mechanics and particle systems.

### Future Sight: The Simulation Hypothesis
Why do this? Why torture myself with Russian textbooks from the 1960s?

Because I believe the future of technology isn't just LLMs or chatbots. It's about **Physicalized AI**—intelligence that understands the physical constraints of reality. I want to explore the intersection of simulation theory, quantum substrates, and how we might one day build AI that "thinks" using the same laws that govern atoms.

But before we can simulate a quantum brain, we have to simulate a falling rock.

So, let's write some code.
