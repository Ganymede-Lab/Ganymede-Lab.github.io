# The Trajectory
The goal is simple, even if the execution is not: __To derive the motion of the universe from scratch.__

We are starting at __Level 0:__

__Math:__ Rusty High School Algebra.
__Physics:__ Basic Newtonian concepts (F=ma).
__Tools:__ Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and a PixelBook.
We are aiming for __Level 100:__

__The Text:__ Landau & Lifshitz, _Course of Theoretical Physics, Vol 1: Mechanics.
__The Math:__ Calculus of Variations, Lagrangian Mechanics, and Differential Equations.
__The Application:__ Building high-fidelity computer simulations of orbital mechanics and particle systems.

## Future Sight The Simulation Hypothesis
Why do this? Why torture myself with Russian textbooks from the 1960s?

Because I believe the future of technology isn’t just LLMs or chatbots. It’s about __Physicalized AI__—intelligence that understands the physical constraints of reality. I want to explore the intersection of simulation theory, quantum substrates, and how we might one day build AI that “thinks” using the same laws that govern atoms.

But before we can simulate a quantum brain, we have to simulate a falling rock.

So, let’s write some code.
